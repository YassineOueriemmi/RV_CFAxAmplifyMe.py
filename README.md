A lightweight Python/Tkinter tool that calculates long/short quantities based on price inputs, base notional, and target net exposure.

This tool computes:

Long & short notionals

Long & short quantities

Custom net exposure (0 → 500k)

Relative-value position sizing between two assets

Designed for quick usage and training practice (AmplifyME, CFA, trading games, interview prep, etc.).

Functionality

Inputs:

Long ticker price

Short ticker price

Base notional

Target net exposure

Calculations:

Long Notional  = Base Notional + (Net Exposure / 2)
Short Notional = Base Notional - (Net Exposure / 2)

Long Quantity  = Long Notional  / Price A
Short Quantity = Short Notional / Price B

How to Run

Python 3.8+ required (Tkinter included by default).
